    <h1>Bollu Venkata Teja acts in a play</h1>

    <h3>Ghosts</h3>
    <h4>Act FIRST By Henrik Ibsen Translated, with an Introduction, by William Archer</h4>

    <p>REGINA. [In a low voice.] What do you want? Stop where you are. You're
        positively dripping.</p>
    <p>ENGSTRAND. Lord, how you talk, Regina. [Limps a step or two forward into
        the room.] It's just this as I wanted to say--</p>
    <p>MANDERS. [Paces the room two or three times, stands a moment in the
        background with his hands behind his back, and looks out over the
        garden. Then he returns to the table, takes up a book, and looks at the
        title-page; starts, and looks at several books.] Ha--indeed!</p>
    <p>MRS. ALVING. That makes it all the kinder of you to come so early.
        Now we can get through our business before dinner. But where is your
        portmanteau?</p>
    <p>OSWALD. Oh, I beg your pardon; I thought you were in the study. [Comes
        forward.] Good-morning, Pastor Manders.</p>  
    <p>MRS. ALVING. Well well, suppose it is. My point is that your judgment
        as to my married life is founded upon nothing but common knowledge and
        report.</p>
    <p>MANDERS. [Softly, so as not to be heard in the dining-room.] Yes; it
        would not do to provoke scandal.</p>
